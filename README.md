# Justice-Release-Text-Analysis
This repository contains code for an text analysis over American Opioid Crisis on media coverage. The corpus adopted is the Department of Justice Press Release, 2009-2018, credit to: https://www.kaggle.com/jbencina/department-of-justice-20092018-press-releases/version/1. 

The analysis focused on unsupervised modeling of topic distributions, semantic evolutions of drug-war related keywords, and media popularities of the new opioid crisis. I also intend to, through analyzing in great detail of both chronological and geographical shifts of keywords semantics, to reflect the hidden ideological difference, and changes of both Republican and Liberal parties from 2009 till 2018.
